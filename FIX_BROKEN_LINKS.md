I have updated `login.html` to remove the dead links to `signuprole.html` and replace them with `homeowner_signup.html`.

This was causing the "Not Found" error when clicking "Sign Up" from the login page.

I also double-checked the following files and confirmed they are clean:
- `landingpage.html`
- `forgot_password.html`
- `engineer_application.html`
- `engineer_pending.html`

Please try again. The redirection should now work correctly.
